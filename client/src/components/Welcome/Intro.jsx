            My name is Amanda and I&apos;m a Junior Software Engineer since Sept

            right opportunity to break into the tech field as a developer. My
            experience in Software Development extends only to web application

                  A Quick Study

                <br />
                If you are clear and thorough, I can be taught anything. I have
                good problem solving skills and intuition. Employers have been
                pleasantly surprised by how quickly they can release me to work
                solo.

                  An Excellent Communicator
                </span>
                <br />I have worked both on-site and remotely. In each role I
                have been thorough in documentation and consistent in
                communication. I wrote documents with recommendations for better
                efficiency, created Excel logs for noticing trends, and
                succeeded as liaison between a call service and the office
                staff.

                <br />I have always given advance notice of sick days, lateness,
                and resignation to employers. I do not bring personal business
                into work, and nothing in my personal life has ever impeded my
                ability to fulfill my responsibilities. When I agree to do
                something, I do it. I can be counted on to do mundane,
                repetitive tasks or fast-paced, challenging tasks, as long as I
                am properly briefed on expectations.

                  A Team Player
                </span>
                <br />I grew up playing sports, volleyball was my favorite. I
                coached HS girls volleyball for five seasons. I went on group
                work trips, service trips (after Katrina), and community
                development trips (East Africa), and for all of these
                experiences I was flexible and willing to take on what was
                needed for the group to succeed. I do not participate in harmful
                workplace gossip, favoritism, or any kind of dishonesty that
                negatively impacts the team.

                <br />I have had such diverse life and work experience, I can be
                valuable to a wide range of employers. I speak English, Swahili,
                and Portuguese and lived more than 3yrs in each country where I
                learned those languages. I have coaching, Early Childhood
                education, audio transcription, website building, senior
                caregiving, and more experience. I&apos;ve worked onsite in a
                school, office, and gym, as well as fully remote contract; my
                shifts varied morning, evening, and overnight.
