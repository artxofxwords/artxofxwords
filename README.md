## Welcome to my Portfolio!

# artxofxwords comes from one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite books: "Till We Have Faces" by C.S. Lewis, a book that gives mythical Orual a voice to make her case against Cupid and Psyche
## "Child, to say the very thing you really mean, the whole of it, nothing more or less or other than what you really mean; that's the whole art and joy of words."

HiðŸŒº My name is Amanda Brennan and I am a Jr. Software Engineer living in Georgia, USA. I work from home so I can homeschool my son and we can spend time traveling to see family, up and down the east coast and halfway around the world. We are lucky!

I love art, linguistics, teaching, volleyball, and gardening. I am learning to love project architecture, documentation, and staying hydrated. I am struggling to love research, networking, and office hours.
